Munt mt32emu
************

mt32emu is a module of the Munt project. It produces a C++ static link library
named libmt32emu which provides classes to emulate (approximately) the Roland
MT-32, CM-32L and LAPC-I synthesiser modules.

This library is intended for developers wishing to integrate an MT-32 emulator
into a driver or application. "Official" drivers for Windows and Linux (with
ALSA) are available in the Munt project and use this library: mt32emu_win32drv
and mt32emu_alsadrv, respectively.

mt32emu can be built using Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003 using the provided
project file (mt32emu_msvc7.vcproj).

For information on building mt32emu using the GNU toolchain, see the INSTALL
file. If this file is not present (e.g. if you have freshly checked this module
out from CVS), run:

sh autogen.sh
